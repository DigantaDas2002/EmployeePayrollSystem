Employee Payroll System

📌 Introduction:

The Employee Payroll System is a Java-based application designed to manage employee payroll details efficiently.
This project mainly focuses on learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction while implementing a real-world payroll system.

🛠️ Features:

Add, update, and remove employees
Calculate payroll based on employee type (Full-time, Part-time)
Store employee details like salary, work hours, and deductions
Generate payroll reports

🎯 OOP Concepts Used:

Encapsulation – Employee details are kept private and accessed through getter/setter methods

Inheritance – FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee classes inherit from the Employee class

Polymorphism – Different types of employees have different salary calculation methods

Abstraction – The payroll system provides a high-level interface to manage employee records
